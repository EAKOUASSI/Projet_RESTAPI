# Projet_RESTAPI

 Your objective

In this checkpoint, you're going to take a series of guided instructions to create a REST API by manipulating your database with mongoosis.

    PS: Don't forget to comment on your code before submitting it.

Instructions

    Start a new Node JS project with npm init.
    Install Mongoose, Express and .en .en.
    Configure environment variables with .env.
    Launch a server with Express in the server.js file.
    Connect your database locally or with Mongo Atlas.

    The structure of the files should be like this:

    Copy

    config/ .env server.js
    Create a model folder and a User.js file inside.
    In User.js, define a Mongoose schema and export the model. You'll use it in server.js.

    The structure of the files should be like this:

    Copy

    config/ .env models/User.js server.js
    In server.js, create four roads:
        GET: MANAGEMENT ALL USERS
        POSTPOST: ADD A NEW USER TO DATASE
        PUTPUT: EDIATE A USER BY ID
        DELETEDELETE: SUPPRIMER A USER BY ID
    Use Postman to test each road.
